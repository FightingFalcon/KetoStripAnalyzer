# Keto Strip Analyzer
This keto strip analyzer is a tool for analyzing images of ketostrip tips to estimate ketone levels. It identifies the color present, and maps it to specific ketone concentration levels based on predefined color standards. 

* Improvements
  * As of right now images need to be manually cropped to include only the tip. Something like tensorflow could be used to train a dataset together with a pre-trained model to identify the tips of the ketostrip.
